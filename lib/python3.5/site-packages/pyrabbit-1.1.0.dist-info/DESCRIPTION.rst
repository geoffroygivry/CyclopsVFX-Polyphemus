There's no way to easily write programs against RabbitMQs management API
without resorting to some messy urllib boilerplate code involving HTTP
Basic authentication and parsing the JSON responses, etc. Pyrabbit
abstracts this away & provides an intuitive, easy way to work with the
data that lives inside of RabbitMQ, and manipulate the resources there.
