Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

- Version 0.2.0 introduced a dependency on PyMongo version 2.4 or later, and
  introduced some potential backwards-breaking changes. Please review the
  `Changelog <http://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#history-and-contributors>`_
  carefully before upgrading.
- Version 0.3.0 removed the `ReadPreference
  <http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/api/pymongo/index.html#pymongo.read_preferences.ReadPreference>`_
  redefinitions in ``flask_pymongo``, in favor of using the constants directly
  from `PyMongo <http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/>`_. Please review the
  `Changelog <http://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#history-and-contributors>`_
  carefully before upgrading.
